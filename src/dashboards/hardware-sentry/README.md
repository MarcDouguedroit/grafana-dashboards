# Hardware Sentry

The Hardware Sentry dashboards give you immediate visibility into your environment. The organized panels expose hardware health metrics for all monitored systems and bring real-time metrics and projected trends on electricity consumption and costs, as well as COâ‚‚ emissions for your entire infrastructure.
