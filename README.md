This is a set of Grafana dashboards that allow users of Sentry Software products to visualize the collected data.

## Hardware Sentry

The Hardware Sentry dashboards give you immediate visibility into your environment. The organized panels expose hardware health metrics for all monitored systems and bring real-time metrics and projected trends on electricity consumption and costs, as well as COâ‚‚ emissions for your entire infrastructure.

Watch the [Sentry Software labs](https://hws-demo.sentrysoftware.com/d/-GV2ChOnz/hardware-sentry-main?orgId=1) running on Grafana with live data.
